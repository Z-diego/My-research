# My research

Welcome to the research repository of Diego Zafra Bono! The repository contains two manuscripts:

## Designing and Simulating Paul Traps: An Introductory Guide to Computational Electromagnetism

- **Collaborators**: Marc López Domènech, Damià Canyameres Morante
- **Status**: Work done as part of the course "Engineering Physics Projects 2" at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC)
- **Abstract**: Numerical design of a Paul trap of ions, and study of the system parameters to ensure successfull trapping
- **Link**: [Designing and Simulating Paul Traps: An Introductory Guide to Computational Electromagnetism](https://github.com/Z-diego/My-research/blob/main/Designing_and_Simulating_Paul_Traps__An_Introductory_Guide_to_Computational_Electromagnetism.pdf)

## The effect of the gravitational redshift on subwavelength atomic arrays

- **Collaborators**: Prof. Susanne Yelin, Oriol Rubies Bigordà
- **Status**: This is a small part of research I have conducted during my appointment as a Visiting Undergraduate Research Fellow at Harvard University in Professor Susanne Yelin's group. These contributions will be published in my Bachelor's thesis on [UPCommons](https://upcommons.upc.edu/)
- **Abstract**: Theoretical and numerical study of the effect of gravitational redshift of subwavelength atomic arrays.
