# My research

This is the unpublished research of Diego Zafra Bono. The repository contains two manuscripts:

* **Designing and Simulating Paul Traps: An Introductory Guide to Computational
Electromagnetism**. Work done as part of the course "Engineering Physics Projects 2" at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC) together with Damià Canyameres Morante and Marc López Domènech, under the guidance of Professor Juan Manuel Rius Casals.

* **The effect of the gravitational redshift on subwavelength atomic arrays**. These are my most recent contributions as a result of my appointment as a Visiting Undergraduate Research Fellow at Harvard University in Professor Susanne Yelin's group, with her help and that of Oriol Rubies Bigorda.
